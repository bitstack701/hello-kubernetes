## Hello Kubernetes
 
 The purpose of this project is to explore the different uses of kubernetes with particular focus on my 
 development workflow.
 
 I would like to use kubernetes and containers to move my application dependencies to containers. So the rough
 idea is to have nginx, redis, rabbitMQ, postgres to be running as services and being able to access them from my 
 local development machine.
